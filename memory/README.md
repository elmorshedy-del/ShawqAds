## Purpose

This directory is a persistent context layer for AI agents and human contributors. It captures verified repository structure, likely workflows, and safety rules so future work starts from shared context.

## Staleness Policy

When a structural change adds or changes packages, endpoints, commands, schemas, storage, build steps, or security boundaries, run `agent-memory maintain --since main` and commit the refreshed memory files.

## Agent Handoff Policy

Agents should record checkpoints during long tasks and create a handoff before switching tools or stopping mid-task. The next agent should read `agent-handoff.md` before continuing.

## Do Not Edit as Source

Generated and vendor directories such as `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, and `target/` should not be treated as source ownership.
